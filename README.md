## LLM Integration Architecture

BlogVerse integrates LLMs through a custom middleware layer that:

1. **Processes user inputs** (writing samples, topic preferences, mood indicators)
2. **Constructs optimized prompts** for different use cases
3. **Handles API communication** with the LLM provider
4. **Post-processes responses** for formatting and presentation
5. **Caches common requests** to improve performance and reduce API costs
